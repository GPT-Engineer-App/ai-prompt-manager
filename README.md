# ai-prompt-manager

Building an AI prompt management plugin for WordPress is a great idea, especially with the increasing use of AI tools in content creation. Hereâ€™s how you can structure your plugin, including its main functions and features:

### 1. Plugin Overview
This plugin will facilitate users to manage AI prompts, store responses, and possibly integrate with AI APIs (like OpenAI) to fetch AI-generated content directly within WordPress.

### 2. Core Features

#### 2.1 Manage Prompts
- **Create/Edit/Delete Prompts:** Users should be able to manage their prompts through a simple interface. This includes creating new prompts, editing existing ones, and deleting them.
- **Save Prompts:** Store prompts in the WordPress database for later use.
- **Categorize Prompts:** Organize prompts into categories for easy retrieval and management.

#### 2.2 API Integration
- **API Settings:** Allow users to configure API keys and settings for different AI services.
- **Send Prompts to AI:** Functionality to send prompts to an AI service and retrieve responses.
- **Save Responses:** Option to save AI-generated responses for future reference or reuse.

#### 2.3 Shortcodes & Widgets
- **Shortcodes:** Implement shortcodes that can be added to posts or pages to display AI-generated content based on specific prompts.
- **Widgets:** Create widgets for use in sidebars or other widget-ready areas of a WordPress site.

#### 2.4 User Interface
- **Admin Panel:** A backend page in the WordPress admin for managing prompts and plugin settings.
- **Front-end Display:** Options for displaying AI content on the website through widgets or embedded in posts/pages.

#### 2.5 Performance and Security
- **Caching Mechanism:** Implement caching to reduce API calls and load times.
- **Security:** Ensure all data sent to and from the AI APIs is secured, and that API keys are stored securely using best practices.

### 3. Technical Architecture

#### 3.1 Custom Post Type
- **Prompt CPT:** Use a custom post type (CPT) to store prompts. This allows for the use of the WordPress core functionality for CRUD operations.

#### 3.2 Custom Tables
- **Responses Table:** Optionally, create a custom table to store responses if they are large or need to be structured in a specific way.

#### 3.3 API Handling
- **API Wrapper Class:** Develop a PHP class to handle API requests and responses. This class will manage all interactions with the AI services.

#### 3.4 Frontend JavaScript
- **AJAX for Dynamic Content:** Use AJAX to dynamically fetch AI-generated content on the frontend without reloading the page.

#### 3.5 Security
- **Nonces for Security:** Use WordPress nonces in AJAX calls to verify requests.
- **Permissions Check:** Ensure that only authorized users can send prompts or access sensitive API configuration.

### 4. Development Plan

#### 4.1 Phase 1: Setup and Basic Functions
- Setup plugin basic structure.
- Implement custom post type for prompts.
- Create basic admin panel.

#### 4.2 Phase 2: API Integration and Advanced Features
- Develop API integration for sending and receiving data.
- Implement advanced features like shortcodes and widgets.

#### 4.3 Phase 3: Testing and Optimization
- Conduct thorough testing, including security audits.
- Optimize performance, focusing on caching mechanisms.

#### 4.4 Phase 4: Launch and Feedback
- Release the plugin.
- Collect user feedback and make necessary adjustments.

### 5. Maintenance and Updates
- Regularly update the plugin to maintain compatibility with the latest WordPress versions and improve security features.

This layout will help you structure your development process and ensure that you cover all critical aspects of building a robust WordPress plugin.
